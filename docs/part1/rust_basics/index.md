# Day 1. I can write

As a Rust developer i want to write and run single threaded one file programs in Rust playground.

* [Numbers, enums, strings. Variables and refrences](./day1/numbers.md)
* [Structs](./day1/structs.md)
* [Ownership, References and Borrowing](./day1/ownership.md)


# Day 2. Program decomposition
As Rust developer i can write simple single threaded programs. Source code is decomposed by functions and types and can use external libraries inside main.rs file.

* [Functions and closures](./day2/functions.md)

# Day 3.Modulariaztion and Abstraction
