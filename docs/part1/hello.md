# Setup development environment
I use Manjaro Linux. 
Install via package manager Rust, Cargo (Rust dependecy management and build tool), Visual Studio Code with Rust plugin.
Next steps are to install Postgres and DBeaver (GUI tool for Postgre).
Thats all.

Create new project. In linux terminal run 

```
cargo new rust_rest_example` 
cd rust_rest_example`
cargo run
```

After all you can see "Hello wold" in console. And you can see main.rs in src folder with obvious code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
